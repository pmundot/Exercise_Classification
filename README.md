# Exercise_classification

An exercise classifier was made to try and determine three different types of 
physical exercise with push-ups, squats, and jumping jacks being the three exercises. These three where 
chosen because of the different movements of completion. The squat using the hips and legs to move 
the body up and down in a vertical motion, push-ups using the arms and shoulders to move the body up 
and down in a horizontal motion, and jumping jacks uses both arms and legs to complete the exercise.
These 3 exercises motions are different enough to give this version of the classifier a easier job getting 
the data classified correctly. 

With the exercises chosen, It was time to determine how to obtain the data. In order to 
determine how to achieve this, two things needed to be solved: 1) Is there a package that can generate 
body data points for a picture and 2) is there a dataset of pictures of people working out available for 
the public.
